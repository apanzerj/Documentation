  <title>Creating a Custom HTML Form for Ticket Submission</title>

  <body>
    <p><i/><i>All of the code from this lesson is available on GitHub @
    https://github.com/apanzerj/Former-For-Zendesk/tree/Lesson-1-Branch</i></p>

    <section><title>Objective</title><p>Many of our customers try to modify
    the Feedback Tab to their liking only to find that the tab itself is
    really a fixed entity. Many of it's features are hardcoded and/or
    all-or-nothing. In this article we'll look at how to create your own HTML
    form that will create a new ticket. </p></section>

    <section><title>Tasks:</title><ol>
        <li>Create the form with only the necessary (bare minimum) fields for
        creating a new ticket.</li>

        <li>Make sure our setup grabs only the important fields and ignores
        other input fields in the same form.</li>
      </ol></section>

    <section><title>Tools:</title><ol>
        <li>A server: You're going to need a place to host the finished
        product. It needs to have PHP installed. This is very basic and all
        web hosting providers have this included.</li>

        <li>Your Zendesk API key.</li>
      </ol></section>

    <section><title>The Setup</title><ul>
        <li>We're going to use two documents: former.html and former.php</li>

        <li>The HTML file is going to contain four input boxes: Name, Email
        Address, Subject, and Description</li>

        <li>The PHP file is going to have our curlWrap function, though it
        will be modified, <xref
        href="https://support.zendesk.com/entries/21462093-php-and-zendesk-quick-start-guide">see
        here</xref></li>
      </ul></section>

    <section><title>Let's Begin</title><p>Create 4 text boxes and make sure
    the name on each one matches the specifics in the table below:</p><table>
        <title/>

        <tgroup cols="3">
          <thead>
            <row>
              <entry>Filed Name (HTML)</entry>

              <entry>Zendesk Field</entry>

              <entry>What Goes Here?</entry>
            </row>
          </thead>

          <tbody>
            <row>
              <entry>z_requester</entry>

              <entry>requester</entry>

              <entry>email address</entry>
            </row>

            <row>
              <entry>z_name</entry>

              <entry>name</entry>

              <entry>name</entry>
            </row>

            <row>
              <entry>z_subject</entry>

              <entry>subject</entry>

              <entry>ticket subject</entry>
            </row>

            <row>
              <entry>z_description</entry>

              <entry>description</entry>

              <entry>initial comment</entry>
            </row>
          </tbody>
        </tgroup>
      </table><p><b>Note:</b> The field name is the name attribute of the HTML
    input element. Look below for an example where the name element is
    <u>underlined</u>.</p><codeblock>&lt;input type="text" <u>name="z_name"</u>  value="Your Name Here"&gt;</codeblock></section>
