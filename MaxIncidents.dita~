    <title>MaxIncidents: Alerts Based on Incident Number</title>

    <body>
      <p><b>Objective</b>: We want to be able to alert a manager in times of
      crisis. This is usually when we have a problem with, for example, 10
      incidents attached. </p>

      <p><b>Tools</b>: The function we wrote that wraps around CURL. This is
      included below. If you have used this function previously then that's
      fine but copy the one listed here as it is more complete. </p>

      <p><i>Modifications to curlWrap.</i></p>

      <ol>
        <li>The first thing we need to do is create a new PHP file. To do this
        just create a new document we'll call maxincidents.php</li>

        <li>Inside there we'll put in our standard &lt;?php and ?&gt;</li>

        <li>Now at the top we need our basic include statements:<codeblock>define("ZDAPIKEY", "apikey");
define("ZDUSER", "username");
define("ZDURL", "https://ajpspoke.zendesk.com/api/v2");</codeblock></li>

        <li>Replace the words apikey and username with your API key and
        username from Zendesk. In addition, change the ZDURL to your zendesk
        url. <b>NOTE: YOUR ZDURL NEEDS TO BE AS FORMATED ABOVE WITHOUT A
        TRAILING "/"</b></li>

        <li>Now we're going to include curlWrap. I'm not going to dive into a
        whole lot of detail about what has changed.<codeblock>**FIXME**&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/2920899.js?file=curlWrap.php"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</codeblock></li>
